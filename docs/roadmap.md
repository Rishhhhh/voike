# VOIKE Roadmap

## 2025–2026
- Beta release of unified VOIKE DB + AI platform
- Multi-modal ingestion pipelines across CSV/JSON/media streams
- Serverless runtime with MCP integration + extension marketplace
- Kernel-9 public preview with deterministic + quantum-inspired reasoning APIs

## 2030
- Global AI-first database platform spanning multiple clouds + on-prem
- TB-scale instant forking for analytics and experimentation
- Full OS integration with native LLM inference surfaces
- Enterprise compliance packs (regulated industries, air-gapped deployments)

## 2035
- VOIKE becomes backbone for agentic, AI-driven internet workloads
- Fully autonomous data + compute + AI orchestration with self-tuning kernels
- Seamless integration with edge devices and ambient operating systems

## Guiding Themes
- Hybrid reasoning (SQL + vector + graph + AI) as a first-class programming model
- Cost-aware automation to keep agentic workloads predictable
- Open interfaces (CLI, SDKs, MCP) for builders and LLM agents alike
