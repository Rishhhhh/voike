# Kernel-9 Overview

Kernel-9 (K9) extends Kernel-8 with quantum-inspired sampling, multi-agent arbitration, and deeper vector/graph memory fusion. It acts as VOIKE's advanced reasoning layer for complex agentic workflows.

## Highlights
- Deterministic + stochastic sampling loops inspired by VARVQCQC research
- Multi-agent orchestration with critic/verifier paths
- Deep integration with Developmental AI (DAI) for self-tuning heuristics
- Awareness of cost governor + model router signals for safe execution
