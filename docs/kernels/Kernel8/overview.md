# Kernel-8 Overview

Kernel-8 (K8) is VOIKE's deterministic planner that fuses relational SQL, vector search, and graph traversals. It seeds every query with semantic corrections, cost-aware routing, and Truth Ledger logging.

## Highlights
- Deterministic reasoning with transparent scoring formulas
- Tight integration with VARVQCQC query corrector
- MCP-aware so agents can request tool execution mid-plan
- Feeds Developmental AI (DAI) to adapt heuristics per tenant
