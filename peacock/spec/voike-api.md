# VOIKE API Snapshot

This project embeds the current VOIKE HTTP surface so Peacock’s agents and UI have a local reference. For full details keep this file in sync with `../docs/api.md` at the repo root.

--- START SNAPSHOT ---

```
(see docs/api.md for the complete table)
```

--- END SNAPSHOT ---

Refer to `docs/api.md` in the VOIKE repo for the authoritative version (OpenAPI spec lives alongside the docs). Peacock copies relevant sections into its RAG index so LLM prompts know about `/flow/*`, `/vpkgs/*`, `/orchestrator/*`, etc.
